I've moved away from [Wordpress][] and am now using [Jekyll][] on
[GitHub Pages][] for hosting my website. I've migrated the (abbreviated)
content of the more popular posts, but if you were redirected here
expecting content that wasn't included, [let me
know](mailto:goodman.m.w@gmail.com) and I can add it. While I appreciate
all the helpful and encouraging comments on the original posts, I didn't
migrate comments unless they added a fix or suggestion. The migrated
posts are:

* [Simple logging in BASH scripts]({% post_url 2011-07-04-Simple-logging-in-BASH-scripts %})
* [Accumulating dictionaries in Python]({% post_url 2012-02-09-Accumulating-dictionaries-in-Python %})
* [Python one-liner: Getting only the first match in a list comprehension]({% post_url 2013-01-30-Getting-only-the-first-match-in-a-list-comprehension %})


If others are thinking of migrating from Wordpress (on [Dreamhost][]),
this [post by Lee Munroe][] is useful.
