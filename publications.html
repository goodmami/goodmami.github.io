	  <p class="modal">Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) (Banarescu et al., 2013) is a framework for semantic dependencies that encodes its rooted and directed acyclic graphs in a format called PENMAN notation. The format is simple enough that users of AMR data often write small scripts or libraries for parsing it into an internal graph representation, but there is enough complexity that these users could benefit from a more sophisticated and well-tested solution. The open-source Python library Penman provides a robust parser, functions for graph inspection and manipulation, and functions for formatting graphs into PENMAN notation. Many functions are also available in a command-line tool, thus extending its utility to non-Python setups.</p>

	  <p class="modal">In this paper we discuss the experience of bringing together over 40 different wordnets. We introduce some extensions to the GWA wordnet LMF format proposed in Vossen et al. (2016) and look at how this new information can be displayed. Notable extensions include: confidence, corpus frequency, orthographic variants, lexicalized and non-lexicalized synsets and lemmas, new parts of speech, and more. Many of these extensions already exist in multiple wordnets &endash; the challenge was to find a compatible representation. To this end, we introduce a new version of the Open Multilingual Wordnet (Bond and Foster, 2013), that integrates a new set of tools that tests the extensions introduced by this new format, while also ensuring the integrity of the Collaborative Interlingual Index (CILI: Bond et al., 2016), avoiding the same new concept to be introduced through multiple projects.</p>

          <p class="modal">Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR; Banarescu et al., 2013) encodes the meaning of sentences as a directed graph and Smatch (Cai and Knight, 2013) is the primary metric for evaluating AMR graphs. Smatch, however, is unaware of some meaning-equivalent variations in graph structure allowed by the AMR Specification and gives different scores for AMRs exhibiting these variations. In this paper I propose four normalization methods for helping to ensure that conceptually equivalent AMRs are evaluated as equivalent. Equivalent AMRs with and without normalization can look quite different---comparing a gold corpus to itself with relation reification alone yields a difference of 25 Smatch points, suggesting that the outputs of two systems may not be directly comparable without normalization. The algorithms described in this paper are implemented on top of an existing open-source Python toolkit for AMR and will be released under the same license.</p>

          <p class="modal">We propose neural models to generate high-quality text from structured representations based on Minimal Recursion Semantics (MRS). MRS is a rich semantic representation that encodes more precise semantic detail than other representations such as Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR). We show that a sequence-to-sequence model that maps a linearization of Dependency MRS, a graph-based representation of MRS, to text can achieve a BLEU score of 66.11 when trained on gold data. The performance of the model can be improved further using a high-precision, broad coverage grammar-based parser to generate a large silver training corpus, achieving a final BLEU score of 77.17 on the full test set, and 83.37 on the subset of test data most closely matching the silver data domain. Our results suggest that MRS-based representations are a good choice for applications that need both structured semantics and the ability to produce natural language text as output.</p>

          <p class="modal">Extracting semi-structured text from scientific writing in PDF files is a difficult task that has faced researchers for decades. In the 1990s, this task was largely a computer vision and OCR problem, as PDF files were often the result of scanning printed documents. Today, PDFs have standardized digital typesetting without the need for OCR, but extraction of semi-structured text from these documents remains a nontrivial task. In this paper, we present a system for the reanalysis of glyph-level PDF extracted text that performs block detection, respacing, and tabular data analysis for the purposes of linguistic data mining. We further present our reanalyzed output format, which attempts to eliminate the extreme verbosity of XML output while leaving important positional information available for downstream processes.</p>

          <p class="modal">We describe resources aimed at increasing the usability of the semantic representations utilized within the DELPH-IN (Deep Linguistic Processing with HPSG) consortium. We concentrate in particular on the Dependency Minimal Recursion Semantics (DMRS) formalism, a graph-based representation designed for compositional semantic representation with deep grammars. Our main focus is on English, and specifically English Resource Semantics (ERS) as used in the English Resource Grammar. We first give an introduction to ERS and DMRS and a brief overview of some existing resources and then describe in detail a new repository which has been developed to simplify the use of ERS/DMRS. We explain a number of operations on DMRS graphs which our repository supports, with sketches of the algorithms, and illustrate how these operations can be exploited in application building. We believe that this work will aid researchers to exploit the rich and effective but complex DELPH-IN resources.</p>

          <a class="show-modal"><i class="fas fa-file-alt"></i> Abstract</a>
          <p class="modal">The majority of the world's languages have little to no NLP resources or tools. This is due to a lack of training data (``resources'') over which tools, such as taggers or parsers, can be trained. In recent years, there have been increasing efforts to apply NLP methods to a much broader swath of the world's languages. In many cases this involves bootstrapping the learning process with enriched or partially enriched resources. We propose that Interlinear Glossed Text (IGT), a very common form of annotated data used in the field of linguistics, has great potential for bootstrapping NLP tools for resource-poor languages. Although IGT is generally very richly annotated, and can be enriched even further (e.g., through structural projection), much of the content is not easily consumable by machines since it remains ``trapped'' in linguistic scholarly documents and in human readable form. In this paper, we describe the expansion of the ODIN resource---a database containing many thousands of instances of IGT for over a thousand languages. We enrich the original IGT data by adding word alignment and syntactic structure. To make the data in ODIN more readily consumable by tool developers and NLP researchers, we adopt and extend a new XML format for IGT, called Xigt. We also develop two packages for manipulating IGT data: one, INTENT, enriches raw IGT automatically, and the other, XigtEdit, is a graphical IGT editor.</p>

          <p class="modal">The current release of the ODIN (Online Database of Interlinear Text) database contains over 150,000 linguistic examples, from nearly 1,500 languages, extracted from PDFs found on the web, representing a significant source of data for language research, particularly for low-resource languages. Errors introduced during PDF-totext conversion or poorly formatted examples can make the task of automatically analyzing the data more difficult, so we aim to clean and normalize the examples in order to maximize accuracy during analysis. In this paper we describe a system that allows users to automatically and manually correct errors in the source data in order to get the best possible analysis of the data. We also describe a RESTful service for managing collections of linguistic examples on the web. All software is distributed under an open-source license.</p>

These constraints are modeled with co-occurrence restrictions via flags set by lexical rules. Together with other new features, such as the ability to define disjunctive requirements and lexical rule hierarchies, these co-occurrence restrictions allow more complex, long-distance restrictions for phenomena such as bipartite stems, inclusive and exclusive OR-patterned restrictions on morpheme occurrence, constraints dependent on lexical type, and more. I show how the system is able to correctly handle patterns of French object clitics, Lushootseed tense and aspect markers, and Chintang bipartite stems.</p>

          <p class="modal">Interlinear glossed text (IGT, the familiar three-line format of linguistic examples) can be an extremely rich source of linguistic information, when linguists follow best practices in creating it (e.g., the Leipzig glossing rules, Comrie et al. 2003). The ODIN project (http://www.csufresno.edu/odin; Lewis 2006) recognized the value of IGT data as a reusable data type and has created a searchable IGT database.This paper represents early efforts in a project to combine aggregations of IGT with a second source of linguistic knowledge to automatically produce implemented formal grammars. The second source of linguistic knowledge is the LinGO Grammar Matrix customization system (Bender et al. 2010). The Grammar Matrix is a multilingual grammar engineering project which includes a cross-linguistic core HPSG (Pollard and Sag 1994) grammar and a set of analyses for cross-linguistically variable phenomena which can be selected via a web-based questionnaire. As an initial pilot study, we focus on verb morphology (including morphotactics and the morphosyntactic effects of affixes) and we begin with a best-case scenario: For our IGT, we use the complete paradigm for the French verb faire (‘to do/make’) provided by Olivier Bonami (pc), including 15,658 phonologically transcribed, morphologically segmented and glossed verb forms.</p>

          <p class="modal">This demonstration presents the LinGO Grammar Matrix grammar customization system: a repository of distilled linguistic knowledge and a web-based service which elicits a typological description of a language from the user and yields a customized grammar fragment ready for sustained development into a broad-coverage grammar. We describe the implementation of this repository with an emphasis on how the information is made available to users, including in-browser testing capabilities.</p>

          <p class="modal">In this paper, we present refinements to the Grammar Matrix’s original morphotactic infrastructure (O’Hara, 2008), in order to better meet two constraints: (i) The system must be able to handle all types of morpheme co-occurrence restrictions found in the world’s languages; and (ii) the grammars it produces must be human- as well as machine-readable, i.e., suitable for extension and maintenance by grammar engineers.</p>

          <p class="modal">We demonstrate that the bidirectionality of deep grammars, allowing them to generate as well as parse sentences, can be used to automatically and effectively identify errors in the grammars. The system is tested on two implemented HPSG grammars: Jacy for Japanese, and the ERG for English. Using this system, we were able to increase generation coverage in Jacy by 18% (45% to 63%) with only four weeks of grammar development.</p>

          <p class="modal">The TaskTracer system allows knowledge workers to define a set of activities that characterize their desktop work. It then associates with each user-defined activity the set of resources that the user accesses when performing that activity. In order to correctly associate resources with activities and provide useful activity-related services to the user, the system needs to know the current activity of the user at all times. It is often convenient for the user to explicitly declare which activity he/she is working on.But frequently the user forgets to do this. TaskTracer applies machine learning methods to detect undeclared activity switches and predict the correct activity of the user. This paper presents TaskPredictor2, a complete redesign of the activity predictor in TaskTracer and its notification user interface. TaskPredictor2 applies a novel online learning algorithm that is able to incorporate a richer set of features than our previous predictors. We prove an error bound for the algorithm and present experimental results that show improved accuracy and a 180-fold speedup on real user data. The user interface supports negotiated interruption and makes it easy for the user to correct both the predicted time of the task switch and the predicted activity.</p>
