  abstract     = {The TaskTracer system allows knowledge workers to define a set of activities that characterize their desktop work. It then associates with each user-defined activity the set of resources that the user accesses when performing that activity. In order to correctly associate resources with activities and provide useful activity-related services to the user, the system needs to know the current activity of the user at all times. It is often convenient for the user to explicitly declare which activity he/she is working on.} # {But frequently the user forgets to do this. TaskTracer applies machine learning methods to detect undeclared activity switches and predict the correct activity of the user. This paper presents TaskPredictor2, a complete redesign of the activity predictor in TaskTracer and its notification user interface. TaskPredictor2 applies a novel online learning algorithm that is able to incorporate a richer set of features than our previous predictors. We prove an error bound for the algorithm and present experimental results that show improved accuracy and a 180-fold speedup on real user data. The user interface supports negotiated interruption and makes it easy for the user to correct both the predicted time of the task switch and the predicted activity.}

The system is tested on two implemented HPSG grammars: Jacy for Japanese, and the ERG for English. Using this system, we were able to increase generation coverage in Jacy by 18% (45% to 63%) with only four weeks of grammar development.}

  abstract  = {Interlinear glossed text (IGT, the familiar three-line format of linguistic examples) can be an extremely rich source of linguistic information, when linguists follow best practices in creating it (e.g., the Leipzig glossing rules, Comrie et al. 2003). The ODIN project (http://www.csufresno.edu/odin; Lewis 2006) recognized the value of IGT data as a reusable data type and has created a searchable IGT database.} # {This paper represents early efforts in a project to combine aggregations of IGT with a second source of linguistic knowledge to automatically produce implemented formal grammars. The second source of linguistic knowledge is the LinGO Grammar Matrix customization system (Bender et al. 2010). The Grammar Matrix is a multilingual grammar engineering project which includes a cross-linguistic core HPSG (Pollard and Sag 1994) grammar and a set of analyses for cross-linguistically variable phenomena which can be selected via a web-based questionnaire. As an initial pilot study, we focus on verb morphology (including morphotactics and the morphosyntactic effects of affixes) and we begin with a best-case scenario: For our IGT, we use the complete paradigm for the French verb faire (‘to do/make’) provided by Olivier Bonami (pc), including 15,658 phonologically transcribed, morphologically segmented and glossed verb forms.}

  abstract = {This paper presents a new morphological framework for a grammar customization system. In this new system, the Lexical Integrity Principle is upheld with regards to morphological and syntactic processes, but the requirements for wordhood are expanded from a binary distinction to a set of constraints. These constraints are modeled with co-occurrence restrictions via flags set by lexical rules. Together with other new features, such as the ability to define disjunctive requirements and lexical rule hierarchies, these co-occurrence restrictions allow more complex, long-distance restrictions for phenomena such as bipartite stems, inclusive and exclusive OR-patterned restrictions on morpheme occurrence, constraints dependent on lexical type, and more. I show how the system is able to correctly handle patterns of French object clitics, Lushootseed tense and aspect markers, and Chintang bipartite stems.}

Our experience report reflects on the ways in which this task is non-trivial and on mismatches between the assumptions of the methodology and the realities of IGT as produced in a large-scale field project.}

To make the data in ODIN more readily consumable by tool developers and NLP researchers, we propose a new XML format for IGT, called Xigt. We call the updated release ODIN-II.}

This is due to a lack of training data (“resources”) over which tools, such as taggers or parsers, can be trained. In recent years, there have been increasing efforts to apply NLP methods to a much broader swathe of the worlds languages. In many cases this involves bootstrapping the learning process with enriched or partially enriched resources. One promising line of research involves the use of Interlinear Glossed Text (IGT), a very common form of annotated data used in the field of linguistics. Although IGT is generally very richly annotated, and can be enriched even further (e.g., through structural projection), much of the content is not easily consumable by machines since it remains “trapped” in linguistic scholarly documents and in human readable form. In this paper, we introduce several tools that make IGT more accessible and consumable by NLP researchers.}
